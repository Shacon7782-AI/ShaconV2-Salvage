# The Antigravity Engine: Technical Architecture of the Agentic Development Era

## 1. The Paradigm Shift: From Code Assistance to Agentic Orchestration
Strategic pivot from legacy IDEs to "Agentic Development Platforms." Focus on "Vibe Coding" where the developer acts as the "Visionary Architect and Supervisor."

### Core Tenets
- **Trust:** Built through Task-Level Abstractions (Artifacts).
- **Autonomy:** Peak performance in **Loki Mode** (terminal + browser + editor parallel swarming).
- **Feedback:** Asynchronous "Google-doc style" comments on artifacts.
- **Self-Improvement:** Persistent knowledge base ingestion (NotebookLM/MCP).

## 2. Dual-Surface Architecture: Editor vs. Agent Manager
| Feature | Editor View (Synchronous) | Agent Manager (Asynchronous) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Operational Mode** | Real-time text/LSP. | Multi-threaded swarm orchestration. |
| **User Role** | Execution/Collaboration. | Strategic Oversight/Mission Control. |
| **Pedigree** | Fork of VS Code. | No-code conversation/artifact view. |

## 3. Intelligence Orchestration: Dual-Mode Task Management
- **Planning Mode:** Deep Research via Gemini 3 Pro (High). Generates structured implementation plans.
- **Fast Mode:** Low-latency execution via Gemini 3 Flash. Used for routine commands and quick fixes.
- **Security Gate:** "Step Requires Input" protocol for high-impact terminal/filesystem actions.

## 4. Model Optimization Logic
- **Primary Engines:** Gemini 3.0 family (Pro High/Low, Flash).
- **Lifecycle:** March 31 marks legacy Gemini 2.5 retirement.
- **Optionality:** Support for Claude 3.5 Sonnet / 4.5 and GPT-OSS.
- **Quota Management:** Correlation based on task complexity, refreshed every 5 hours.

## 5. Autonomous Operations: Browser Subagents
- **Surface Actuation:** Interacting with SCM, localhost, and documentation.
- **DOM Analysis:** Real-time verification of frontend implementation.
- **Self-Grading:** Capture of recordings/screenshots for visual proof of work.

## 6. Transparency and Verification: The Artifact System
- **Implementation Plans:** Post-research strategies.
- **Walkthroughs:** Post-implementation summaries.
- **Visual Artifacts:** Screenshots and recordings.
- **Markdown Logs:** Auditable progress summaries.

## 7. Knowledge Grounding: Agent Skills & NotebookLM
- **Agent Skills:** Modular "micro-brains" (symlinked via `~/.gemini/antigravity/skills`).
- **MCP Bridge:** The "USB-C for AI" connecting to NotebookLM.
- **Loki Mode:** Fact-retrieval from NotebookLM while parallel agents execute tasks.

## 8. Conclusion
Antigravity merges research, planning, and execution into a single, autonomous pipeline, empowering architects to manage complex swarms effectively.

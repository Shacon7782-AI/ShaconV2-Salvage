# 30-Day Goldie Gravity Launch Roadmap: Mastering Agentic Automation

## 1. The "Light Switch" Moment: Embracing the Architect Mindset
Software engineering has shifted from rigid syntax (wiring circuits by hand) to **Vibe Coding** (flipping a switch). The user acts as the **Visionary Architect** (like Richard Branson or Walt Disney), focusing on high-level vision while AI agents act as the technical crew.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Vibe Coding** is describing your intent in plain English ("the vibe") and letting AI handle execution, debugging, and environment management.

## 2. Phase 1: Liftoff (Days 1–7) – Establishing Your Agentic Environment
- **Deploy the IDE:** Setup the standalone Antigravity IDE.
- **Secure the Workspace:** Create a sandboxed project folder.
- **Command the Agents:**
    - Enable **Terminal Command Auto-Approval** for speed.
    - Grant **Browser Agent Permissions** for research/UI testing.

## 3. Phase 2: Building Blocks (Days 8–14) – Mastering Fast Mode & Simple Tools
- **Goal:** Build foundational tools (e.g., a To-Do List App) to learn engine "gears."
- **Modality Selection:**
    - **Fast Mode:** Immediate execution (Gemini 3 Flash).
    - **Planning Mode:** Deep research (Gemini 3 Pro High Reasoning).

## 4. Phase 3: Architecting the Future (Days 15–21) – Complex Business Solutions
- **Contextual Grounding:** Use `@notebooklm` to inject the project’s "Source of Truth."
- **Orchestration:** Parallel agent management (UI, Server, Browser).
- **The Artifact Gate:** Mandatory Planning Artifacts before any code generation to prevent hallucinations.
- **Aesthetic Direction:** Using "Vibe Coding" for UI effects like Glassmorphism.

## 5. Phase 4: The Refinement Loop (Days 22–28) – Feedback & Verification
- **Implementation Plan:** Logic check before action.
- **Browser Recordings:** Functional proof/UI testing.
- **Screenshots:** Visual audit.
- **Asynchronous Feedback:** Use "Google-Doc style comments" on artifacts for real-time course correction.

## 6. Phase 5: Scaling & Liftoff (Days 29–30) – Deployment and Integration
- **Deployment:** Invoke skills like **Vercel** or **Netlify** via terminal (e.g., `app vercel deployment`).
- **Activation:** Use **Loki Mode** for autonomous workflow management and continuous scaling.
- **Connectivity:** Use **MCP** (Model Context Protocol) as the "USB-C for AI" to connect agents to any data source.

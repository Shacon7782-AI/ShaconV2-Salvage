# Vibe Coding 101: Mastering App Creation in the Agent-First Era

## 1. The Paradigm Shift: From Syntax to Sentiment
Shift from Syntax-Oriented Development to **Task-Oriented Orchestration**. Creators act as **Visionary Architects and Supervisors**, managing "agentic swarms" rather than writing boilerplate.

### The Evolution of Creation
| Feature | Traditional Coding | Vibe Coding |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Primary Interface** | Manual syntax and rigid logic. | Natural language and sentiment. |
| **Technical Barrier** | High (years of study). | Low (structured vision). |
| **Abstraction Level** | Line-by-line "Writer". | High-level "Architect/Supervisor". |
| **Iteration Speed** | Slow prototyping. | Rapid "vibe" checks; instant execution. |
| **Grounding** | Manual lookup. | Source-grounded via MCP/NotebookLM. |

## 2. Your AI Engineering Squad: Agentic Roles
- **The Developer Agent:** Lead engineer for architectural planning and code authorship. Coordinates Loki Mode.
- **The Tester Agent:** Autonomous verification via browser actuation, screen recordings, and screenshots.
- **The Bug-Fixer Agent:** Traces errors using playback tools and applies resolution logic autonomously.

## 3. Core Surfaces of Antigravity
1. **The Agent Manager (Orchestration):** No-code surface for spawning agents and reviewing implementation plans.
2. **The Editor (Verification):** Fork of VS Code for physical file verification and technical sanity checks.
3. **The Browser Agent (Actuation):** UI testing and live web interaction for validation.

## 4. Mastering Agentic Prompting
- **Context + Goal:** High-signal directives defining aesthetic (e.g., "Glassmorphism") and intent.
- **Constraints:** Detailed functionality and design requirements in bullets.
- **Model Selection:** Gemini 3 Flash (speed/UI) or Gemini 3 Pro High (architecture).
- **Plan-First Safety:** Mandatory "Implementation Plan Artifact" before any code generation.
- **Verification Request:** Mandatory screenshots and browser recordings.

## 5. Artifacts and Trust
- **Implementation Plans:** Review logic post-research and pre-implementation.
- **Walkthrough Videos/Screenshots:** Visual evidence of UI/UX fidelity.
- **Code Diffs:** Granular file verification in the Editor.

## 6. The "Brain" Integration: NotebookLM & MCP
Grounds the creative process in project-specific data (PDFs, Docs, Specs) using the `@notebooklm` skill to eliminate hallucinations.

## 7. The 30-Day "Goldie Gravity" Framework
- **Phase 1: Liftoff (Days 1–7):** Environment setup and basic prompting.
- **Phase 2: Simple Tools (Days 8–14):** Build single-purpose utilities.
- **Phase 3: Complex Tools (Days 15–21):** Persistence, dashboards, and deep reasoning models.
- **Phase 4: Refine (Days 22–28):** Browser actuation for polishing.
- **Phase 5: Scale (Days 29–30):** Live deployment and Loki Mode maintenance.

# Visual Architecture: From Coder to AI Architect

This document transcribes the information contained in the visual infographics and mind maps provided during ingestion.

## 1. Infographic: "Google Antigravity: From Coder to AI Architect"

### Mission Control: Active Agent Orchestration
The central hub for managing agentic swarms. It visualizes the relationship between the Architect and the fleet of agents.

### Key Agentic Features
- **Orchestration-First Agent Management:** A centralized dashboard for debugging, refactoring, and parallel task execution.
- **Autonomous Browser Automation:** Agents actuate Chrome to perform UI testing, dashboard reads, and self-grade their own performance.
- **Modular Agent Skills:** Reusable `.md` "micro-brains" that teach agents specific domain expertise such as front-end design or deployment.
- **Source-Grounded Intelligence:** Integration with NotebookLM via MCP to ensure agents code based on specific project documentation and eliminate hallucinations.

### The Dual-Surface Workspace
- **Editor:** Used for synchronous coding and direct file manipulation.
- **Agent Manager:** Used for asynchronous mission control, strategic oversight, and orchestration.

### Operational Modes Matrix
| Mode | Reasoning Depth | Primary Output |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Fast Mode** | Low-latency / Immediate | Find code changes only. |
| **Planning Mode** | Deep research / Chain-of-thought | Task lists, plans, and switch logs. |
| **Browser Agent** | Use DOM actuation | Screenshots and recordings. |

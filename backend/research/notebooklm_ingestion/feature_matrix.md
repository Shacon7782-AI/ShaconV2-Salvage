# Antigravity Engine: Feature Matrix

| Feature Name | Description | Primary Benefit | Operating Mode/Mechanism | Associated Model | Source |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Agent Management** | Centralized dashboard/orchestration surface for multiple asynchronous agents. | Enhances productivity and real-time visibility across projects. | Asynchronous orchestration via Manager Surface (Mission Control). | Gemini 3 Pro | [1-4] |
| **Planning Mode** | High-reasoning modality for deep research and structured task architecture. | Allows for logic approval and architectural mapping before code execution. | Deep research cycle generating Implementation Plans/Task Lists. | Gemini 3 Pro (High/Deep Think) | [3-6] |
| **Browser Automation** | Native Chrome integration (Browser Agent) for DOM manipulation and web navigation. | Streamlines UI testing and autonomous completion of external tasks. | Agent-operated visual loop using specialized browser subagent. | Nano Banana Pro (Vision/UI) | [1, 4, 5, 7] |
| **Artifact Generation** | Automatic creation of plans, logs, diagrams, and recordings. | Solves the 'Trust Gap' with verifiable, auditable proof of work. | Tangible deliverables with Google Docs-style commenting support. | Gemini 3 | [1, 3-5, 8] |
| **Fast Mode** | Low-latency modality for immediate execution of simple, localized tasks. | Maximizes speed for routine actions (code completion, renaming). | Direct execution phase skipping the research/planning stage. | Gemini 3 Pro (Low) or Flash | [3-6] |
| **Swarm Architecture** | Coordinated team of specialized agents (Security, QA, Frontend) in parallel. | Multiplies throughput with dedicated expertise for each domain. | Dynamic subagent deployment with shared memory/conflict resolution. | Gemini 3 Pro | [5, 7] |
| **Model Optimization** | Intelligent toggle for reasoning depth and selection of underlying models. | Preserves compute quota by utilizing faster models for routine work. | Manual/Automatic selection via Model Selection dropdown. | Gemini 3, Flash, Nano Banana Pro, Gemma, Claude, GPT-OSS | [1, 5] |
| **NotebookLM Integration** | Connection to research engine for source-grounded planning/generation. | Reduces hallucinations via grounded 'Memory' and citations. | MCP servers, Agent Skills, or programmatic drivers. | Gemini 1.5/3 (integrated) | [5, 6, 9] |
| **Tab & Command** | AI modalities integrated directly within the editor for micro-tasks. | Rapid, familiar AI assistance for code-level edits. | Fast Mode/Inline autocomplete/instructive editing. | N/A | [4] |
| **Smart Reminders** | Dynamic, on-device hydration coach and motivational notifications. | Privacy-first experience using local health/app data. | On-device processing using small-footprint models. | Gemma 3n | [10] |

# Research Guide: Sovereign LLM OS & Federated Transfer Switch

This guide outlines the research and development path for the **Antigravity Federated Transfer Switch**, a critical component for achieving absolute data sovereignty in a multi-model ecosystem.

## I. Concept: The Federated Transfer Switch

As defined in the **Antigravity Capability Report**, the Transfer Switch is an intelligent routing layer that determines where a specific reasoning task should be executed based on three metrics:

1. **Sovereignty Score:** Does the task involve PII, proprietary code, or constitutional logic? (Route: **LOCAL**)
2. **Reasoning Depth:** Does the task require massive context or complex frontier-level reasoning? (Route: **REMOTELY via Secure Proxy**)
3. **Latency/Cost:** Is this a routine task that can be handled by a fast, low-cost model? (Route: **FAST LOCAL**)

## II. Research Objectives

### 1. Federated Context Management

- **Goal:** Share "Short-term Memory" across multiple local and remote nodes without sending the full raw data to third parties.
- **Investigation:** RAG techniques (PrivateGPT, Local Vector DBs) vs. Federated Learning.

### 2. Intelligent Routing Heuristics

- **Goal:** Define a quantitative model for the "Transfer Switch."
- **Metrics to define:**
  - `SecurityRequirement` [0.0 - 1.0]
  - `ComplexityEstimate` [0.0 - 1.0]
  - `BudgetAllocation` [USD per 1M tokens]

### 3. Local Model Optimization (The Edge Kernel)

- **Goal:** Optimize 7B-14B parameter models on local hardware to handle "Guardrail" and "Orchestration" tasks.
- **Tools:** llama.cpp, Ollama, vLLM.

## III. Implementation Roadmap

1. **Phase 1 (Mocking):** Implement the routing logic in Python with "Dummy" switches to verify state management.
2. **Phase 2 (Edge Deployment):** Deploy a local Llama-3-8B instance to handle `protocol_guards`.
3. **Phase 3 (Full Synthesis):** Integrate the switch into the `orchestrator` agent's core delegation loop.

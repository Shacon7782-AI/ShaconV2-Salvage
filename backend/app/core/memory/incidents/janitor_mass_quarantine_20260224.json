    "incident_id": "JANITOR_MASS_QUARANTINE_001",
    "timestamp": "2026-02-24T03:15:00",
    "severity": "CRITICAL",
    "summary": "Massive file quarantine occurred due to incomplete structural law and missing safeguard logic.",
    "root_cause": "Structural law omissions (frontend/, testsprite_tests/) combined with an excessively high safety threshold (50) and a failure to dynamically validate file ownership against agent roles defined in `AGENTS.md`.",
    "impact": [
        "Critical frontend assets (App.jsx, index.css, main.jsx) were moved to quarantine.",
        "User development flow was interrupted.",
        "System reporting (Sentinel) reported instability."
    ],
    "remediation_actions": [
        "Updated `structure.shacon.yml` to authorize all standard development paths.",
        "Implemented a 50-file Safety Valve in `janitor.py` to prevent future mass moves without human intervention.",
        "Restored files from quarantine using Git and filename-based mapping.",
        "Created this memory log for permanent system awareness."
    ],
    "preventative_measures": "New structural laws are frozen and require human review. Automated scripts now include threshold checks for high-impact file operations."

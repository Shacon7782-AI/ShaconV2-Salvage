# Document Cross-Reference & Research Audit

This report maps the physical markdown documents found in the `ShaconV2` project against references identified in the `memory.json` ledger.

## 🟢 Verified & Salvaged Documents
The following documents are present in the current physical state and match system memory.

| File Name | Physical Path | Context / Memory Link |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `README.md` | 루트 (`/`) | Core project overview and Phase 3 goals. |
| `video_process.md` | `backend/app/core/memory/` | Cinematic video implementation path (MEM-083). |
| `comprehensive_report.md` | `backend/research/notebooklm_ingestion/` | ShaconV2 Vision & Dual-Surface Architecture. |
| `technical_architecture.md` | `backend/research/notebooklm_ingestion/` | Agentic Development Era & Swarm/LLM Waterfall. |
| `roadmap.md` | `backend/research/notebooklm_ingestion/` | Project progression and hardware milestones. |
| `implementation_strategy.md`| `backend/research/notebooklm_ingestion/` | Tactical execution for hybrid AI. |
| `feature_matrix.md` | `backend/research/notebooklm_ingestion/` | Capability mapping for Shacon components. |
| `vibe_coding_101.md` | `backend/research/notebooklm_ingestion/` | Aesthetic development methodology. |
| `visual_architecture_summary.md` | `backend/research/notebooklm_ingestion/` | Summarized design system and UI flows. |

## 🔴 Missing Governance Documents
These files are referenced in `memory.json` as critical governance or spec docs but are **NOT** present in the current project state. They are presumed lost during the Janitor purge incidents (MEM-009, MEM-105).

| File Name | Last Mentioned | Content Description (from Logs) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `PRD.md` | MEM-009 | Quarantined during Feb 15 structural collapse. |
| `CONSTITUTION.md`| MEM-096 | Codified Article XIV: Pre-Planning Protocol (Clean-Slate Law). |
| `AGENTS.md` | MEM-096 | Maintained Agent Obligation and protocol adherence logic. |
| `README.v3.md` | Step 706 Audit | Previous version of project documentation. |

## 🛡️ Current Governance Baseline (Salvage Phase)
Newly established artifacts to stabilize and lock down the salvaged state.

| File Name | Path | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `FORENSIC_SALVAGE_REPORT.md`| `governance/` | Audit of recovered Git state and memory ledger. |
| `LOCKDOWN_PROTOCOL.md`| `governance/` | Enforcement of Human-Only Modification policy. |

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The loss of `CONSTITUTION.md` and `AGENTS.md` is a significant governance gap. However, the logic from these files has been partially reconstructed in the `LOCKDOWN_PROTOCOL.md` and documented as lessons in `memory.json`.

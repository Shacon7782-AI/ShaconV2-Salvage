# System Lockdown Protocol: Human Only Modification

## 1. Effective Baseline
- **Authoritative Commit:** `efcc482` ("STABILIZATION: Lock Singularity Core")
- **Baseline Timestamp:** 2026-02-27 02:05:10 AM
- **Current Status:** SYSTEM LOCKED

## 2. Human Only Modification Policy
As of Feb 27, 2026, the ShaconV2 system enters a **Strict Human Gated** state.
- **Prohibition:** No autonomous agent (including Antigravity) is permitted to write, modify, or delete any file within the `ShaconV2/` project directory without explicit human verification and approval of the specific diff.
- **Verification:** Every modification must be cross-referenced against the `efcc482` baseline.
- **Scope:** Source code, configuration, and governance documents.

## 3. Mandatory Audit Cadence
- **Agent Roles:** Read-only mode for Research, Audit, and Planning.
- **State Preservation:** `memory.json` (MEM-147) is the final un-locked ledger entry.

## 4. Exceptional Release
Deviations require a clear "OVERRIDE LOCKDOWN" instruction from @ShaCon.
